Powerful and stout of mind and true to his creator, he stepped down the street, the path guiding him— so no man could recognize him nor the sinful see him. The Guardian of Victories had prudently concealed the beloved folk-prince from sight with his hand inside the city. When noble Andrew had pressed inwards, Christ’s champion, near to the prison, he saw a heap of heathens together, herdsmen standing before the grated door, seven at once. Death seized them suddenly, they fell ingloriously— the fatal rush grasping the sword-bloody warriors.","ða wæs gemyndig modgeþyldig, beorn beaduwe heard, eode in burh hraðe, anræd oretta, elne gefyrðred, maga mode rof, meotude getreowe, stop on stræte, (stig wisode), swa him nænig gumena ongitan ne mihte, synfulra geseon.

The prison door buckled at once through the hand-grip of the Holy Ghost, and there he went in, mindful of courage, the battle-brave man. The heathens slept, drunk in blood, reddening the death-hall.","ða se halga gebæd bilwytne fæder, breostgehygdum herede on hehðo heofoncyninges þrym, godes dryhtendom.

Then he arose to face him and thanked God that they had ever been allowed to see each other unscathed under the sun. Peace was mutual between both those brothers, bliss renewed. Each covered the other with arms, they kissed each other and embraced. Both were beloved by Christ at heart. Light shone around them, holy and heaven-bright. Then his breast was welling with delights, when Andrew, wordfully began to greet his noble and god-fearing companion in the barred-coffer with speech, and spoke to him about the battle to come, fighting of hostile men: “Now there will be a yearning in this folk, heroes hither on…”","Geseh þa under swegle swæsne geferan, halig haligne.

Thus the holy man in the harm-closure hailed his God and asked his Savior for succor and assistance— before their flesh perished before the battle-power of the heathens—and then led the prisoners from their limb-fetters, out of the fastness into the Lord’s peace, one hundred and forty-two men all told by count, delivered from the malice— he left none there fixed in bonds under the city’s enclosure— and furthermore, he freed the frightened women there, one less than fifty, as an increase of his host. They were glad for the journey, quickly departed— not one waited for long inside the sorrow-house, anticipating the battle.","gewyrht eardes neosan."" æfter þyssum wordum wuldres þegnas, begen þa gebroðor, to gebede hyldon, sendon hira bene fore bearn godes.

He had covered the host on their desired journey, with clouds lest the shield-haters should come shooting with a flurry of arrows, their old foes. Then the headstrong men held council there between them, faith-friends, before turning their two ways. Either of those earls confirmed the hope for the heavenly-realm in the other, and wordfully warded away the torments of hell. So these war-farers, heroes stout-minded, proven champions, honored the King with holy voices, the Wielder of the World’s Way, whose glory at the End of Time will never be grasped by men.","Gewat þa Matheus menigo lædan on gehyld godes, swa him se halga bebead.

Then he sat himself beside its base—he had pure love, an eternal high-thought for the bliss of angels. Beneath the city walls, he awaited there whatever war-deeds were his lot. Then crowds gathered from afar, the first-spears of the people. To the pens the faithless army had come with their weapons, those heathen battle-men, to their captives who had previously suffered under prison-shade.","Gewat him þa Andreas inn on ceastre glædmod gangan, to þæs ðe he gramra gemot, fara folcmægen, gefrægen hæfde, oððæt he gemette be mearcpaðe standan stræte neah stapul ærenne.

That thought sailed away after the angry ash-bearers, with their band found the prison door wide open, the hammered work unclosed and the herdsmen all dead. Then they soon turned, unhappy, deprived of their desire, to bear the grievous news. They said unto their people that they did not discover any of the far-comers, the foreign-speakers remaining there, that were alive in the prison. Instead the guards lay there gory, lifeless in the dust, deprived of breath, doomed flesh-houses. Then many of the people’s leaders grew fearful from the horrible news—abjected, sorrow-minded, expecting famine, that pallid dinner-guest. They knew no better counsel than to devour the departed guards as deathly life-bread. In a single moment, all of the door-watchmen were stirred from their deathbeds by the solemn assembly.","Wendan ond woldon wiðerhycgende þæt hie on elþeodigum æt geworhton, weotude wiste.

Then they accepted this gift in order to serve him up. The people were very desirous for food with a sorrowful mind— there was no joy in treasure, no hope in their hoards.

The miserable boy could find no mercy, no peace among his people, who wished his life and spirit be given to them. The wretches had sought for strife.

That folk-hate was bold and trouble-hard— the troops trembled, proud and daring man-servants, in their desire for murder, they wished, by any means, to bruise the head of the boy-child, to destroy him with spears. God defended him, holy on height, from those heathenish folk. Andrew ordered the weapons of the men in the vanguard to melt away completely, much like wax, lest the shield-haters, those horrid opponents, harm the child with their panoply of blades.","Ne mihte earmsceapen are findan, freoðe æt þam folce, þe him feores wolde, ealdres geunnan.

The heralds cried out, signifying their meat-lack—they stood weary, captives of hunger. Their horned halls and wine-houses stood wasted: the warriors had no need for riches to enjoy in that bitter hour. The cunning-minded sat apart in consultation, meditating upon their miseries. There was no joy in their homeland for them. Then one man often asked the other: “Let no one conceal good lore that holds it in the pith of his prudence.

He cut you closely when he led out from your pens more of man-kind than was appropriate. Now you can easily wreak grief-deeds in reply!

Dancing in the wind blasts of flame encircled the walls and the flood continued to swell. Here was human wailing heard widely, a wretched confusion of old men.

The waters had enveloped it, the mountain-currents flowed over it, the flood was hungry for it—until the swelling sea had risen above a man’s breast, up to the shoulder. Then the noble saint ordered the stream-course to be stilled, the storms to sleep around the stone-hills. Keen and courage-hearted Andrew stepped out, leaving the prison, wise-minded and beloved by God. Immediately there was a path prepared for him, cleared through the river-channel. That victory-field was peaceful— it already was dry, the earth from the flood, wherever his foot stepped.","þa þær Andrea orgete wearð on fyrhðlocan folces gebæro, þær wæs modigra mægen forbeged, wigendra þrym.

The ocean subsided through holy behest, the storm gave ear, the sea-road waited. Next the mountain yawned open, a terrifying crack into the earth, and the flood was allowed to be engulfed therein, the fallow waves. The wounded earth swallowed all of the welling sea. Andrew sent not only the water there, but also fourteen guilty folk-harmers, the worst among their nation. They were sent shaking into destruction by the waves, beneath the abyss of earth. Then were many people timid-hearted, fearful in spirit, in their tracks — they expected a slaughter of women and men, a more wretched period of humiliating circumstances, after the battle-players, stained with evil and murder-guilty were cast beneath the earth.","Wurdon burgware bliðe on mode, ferhðgefeonde. þa wæs forð cumen geoc æfter gyrne.

When that message was spoken graciously to the All-wielding God, the Chief of Nations, according to the speeches of the sainted spirit, then the Lord commanded all the young men to arise uninjured from the dust, those whom the ocean had earlier killed.","Sende þa his bene fore bearn godes, bæd haligne helpe gefremman gumena geogoðe, þe on geofene ær þurh flodes fæðm feorh gesealdon, ðæt þa gastas, gode orfeorme, in wita forwyrd, wuldre bescyrede, in feonda geweald gefered ne wurdan. þa ðæt ærende ealwealdan gode æfter hleoðorcwidum haliges gastes wæs on þanc sprecen, ðeoda ræswan.

Then the people gathered, far and wide, into a troop of men throughout the wine-town, resolute nobles, and their wives among them. They stated that they wished to follow faithfully, promptly take on the bath of baptism, as pleases the Lord, and forsake idolatry and the old idol-havens.","þa se modiga het, cyninges cræftiga, ciricean getimbran, gerwan godes tempel, þær sio geogoð aras þurh fæder fulwiht ond se flod onsprang. þa gesamnodon secga þreate weras geond þa winburg wide ond side, eorlas anmode, ond hira idesa mid, cwædon holdlice hyran woldon, onfon fromlice fullwihtes bæð dryhtne to willan, ond diofolgild, ealde eolhstedas, anforlætan.",85,55,30

There the envoy of God appointed one a learned man, wise of words, a bishop for those people in that bright city, for the need of the nation, and confirmed him, a man named Platan, before that mighty multitude by his apostle-hood. Andrew boldly commanded them to attend to Platan’s teaching eagerly and achieve their salvation.","þa wæs mid þy folce fulwiht hæfen, æðele mid eorlum, ond æ godes riht aræred, ræd on lande mid þam ceasterwarum, cirice gehalgod. þær se ar godes anne gesette, wisfæstne wer, wordes gleawne, in þære beorhtan byrig bisceop þam leodum, ond gehalgode fore þam heremægene þurh apostolhad, Platan nemned, þeodum on þearfe, ond þriste bebead þæt hie his lare læston georne, feorhræd fremedon.",85,63,22

That was a hard fact for the host to endure— that the first of their nation wished to remain no whit longer with them. Then the God of Glory revealed himself, the Lord of Armies, to Andrew on the journey-road, and spoke a word:","Sægde his fusne hige, þæt he þa goldburg ofgifan wolde, secga seledream ond sincgestreon, beorht beagselu, ond him brimþisan æt sæs faroðe secan wolde. þæt wæs þam weorode weorc to geþoligenne, þæt hie se leodfruma leng ne wolde wihte gewunian. þa him wuldres god on þam siðfæte sylfum ætywde, ond þæt word gecwæð, weoruda dryhten:",80,55,25

The Lord of Victory spotted a wonder graven quite elegantly in the likeness of his own angels on the temple wall, splendidly adorning either side.

The Measurer ruled all of the kindred of men, just as he still does today. Therefore good sense must be the best of all things, the spirit’s forethought.

And then to Beowulf, the hedge of the Ingwines bestowed control of them both: the horses and the weapons. He commanded him to enjoy them well. So manfully did the famous prince repay, the hoard-watcher of men, for the storm of battle with horses and treasures, so that never could anyone find fault with them, speak as one might, the truth after right.","Heht ða eorla hleo eahta mearas fætedhleore on flet teon, in under eoderas. þara anum stod sadol searwum fah, since gewurþad; þæt wæs hildesetl heahcyninges, ðonne sweorda gelac sunu Healfdenes efnan wolde.

Many famous treasured swords were seen to be borne before that warrior. Beowulf received them graciously on the floor. He had no need to be ashamed before the fighters on account of those costly gifts I have never learned of many men giving another in a very friendly way, four such treasures, garnished with gold, upon the ale-benches. A crest contained it from without, woven with wires about the roof of the helmet, that head-protection so that the well-filed relic, shower-hardened, could not grievously harm it, when the shieldsman must wade into the gruesome fray.","Forgeaf þa Beowulfe bearn Healfdenes segen gyldenne sigores to leane; hroden hildecumbor, helm ond byrnan, mære maðþumsweord manige gesawon beforan beorn beran.

They did not know one fact, when they entered the fray, battle kin with hardened hearts, thinking to chop at Grendel from every side, seeking his soul—that no battle-blade, none of the choicest iron upon the earth, would wish to bite that sinful scather, for he had bewitched the bane from triumphant weaponry, from every sword-edge. Yet his life-leaving must be miserable on this day in this world, and that estranged spirit must ferry forth into the keeping of fiends.","Nolde eorla hleo ænige þinga þone cwealmcuman cwicne forlætan, ne his lifdagas leoda ænigum nytte tealde. þær genehost brægd eorl Beowulfes ealde lafe, wolde freadrihtnes feorh ealgian, mæres þeodnes, ðær hie meahton swa.

War-glory was given to Beowulf. From there Grendel must fly away, sick to life, under the fen-fastness, joylessly seeking his lair. He knew too well that his life was coming to its conclusion, the count of his days.

Not too little glory sprung from Sigemund since his dying day, after the battle-hardened slew a dragon, the treasure’s watcher. The son of nobles dared to proceed alone under the hoary stone, an audacious deed, nor was Fitela with him. Nevertheless he was victorious so that the sword sliced through that many-coiled wyrm, and stuck it into the wall, the lordly iron. The dragon died through that deed. The fierce opponent had gone in courageously so that he might be allowed to enjoy the ringed hoard of his own will.

I thought to fetter him forthwith with tight bonds on his death-bed so that he lay here, struggling for life in my hand-grip, unless he should relinquish his body… I could not entrap him, when the Measurer didn’t consent, delaying his departure. I didn’t apply myself to him strongly enough, my deadly opponent— Too savagely strong was the fiend in his foot-power.

That bright building was entirely torn up within, bound by iron bands, the hinges cracked open.

From there awoke many ancient spirits. Grendel was one of them a gory outlaw, hateful, who found in Heorot a wakeful man awaiting battle. There the monster attempted to seize him, however, he remembered the extent of his power, a sparkling gift, which God had given him, and he trusted in the grace of the Sole Wielder, his comfort and assistance. Through these he conquered the fiend, humbled the hell-ghast. Abjected, he then fled, deprived of joys, seeking his death-bed, the enemy of mankind.

Nor was that blade useless to the battle-warrior, but he wished to quickly pay back Grendel for his many bloody onslaughts which he made upon the West-Danes, many more times than just once— when he slew in their sleep Hrothgar’s hearth-companions, devoured them slumbering, fifteen Danish men, and another fifteen he dragged away, a hateful exchange. He requited him his reward, the ferocious champion, so that when he saw at rest, war-wearied Grendel lying, deprived of life, just as the battle at Heorot had left him earlier, injured.

Such was marked upon that sword-guard, shining with gold, correctly through rune-staves, set down and spoken by whoever first worked that sword, the best of iron, writhing-hilted and patterned with snakes.","Hroðgar maðelode, hylt sceawode, ealde lafe, on ðæm wæs or writen fyrngewinnes, syðþan flod ofsloh, gifen geotende, giganta cyn (frecne geferdon); þæt wæs fremde þeod ecean dryhtne; him þæs endelean þurh wæteres wylm waldend sealde.

Then the guest in the hall discovered that the battle-bright blade did not wish to bite, to harm her life—instead the edge betrayed the prince in his need. It had endured many hand-meets before, often shearing through helmets and the battle-robes of the fated. This was the first time that the glory of the brave treasure was diminished.","Ongeat þa se goda grundwyrgenne, merewif mihtig; mægenræs forgeaf hildebille, hond sweng ne ofteah, þæt hire on hafelan hringmæl agol grædig guðleoð. ða se gist onfand þæt se beadoleoma bitan nolde, aldre sceþðan, ac seo ecg geswac ðeodne æt þearfe; ðolode ær fela hondgemota, helm oft gescær, fæges fyrdhrægl; ða wæs forma sið deorum madme, þæt his dom alæg.",94,59,35

Then the sea-wolf dragged him, when she  reached the bottom, the ringed prince, to her own home, so he could not, no matter how courageous he was, wield a weapon, but many marvelous sea-monsters harried them while diving with sharp tusks, attacking his battle-sark, terrible beasts tearing. Then the noble warrior saw that he was in some sort of hall of malice, where no water could disturb them, nor, because of that roofed house could the fearful grip of the lake touch them. He saw a fiery light, bright beams, shining brilliantly.","Grap þa togeanes, guðrinc gefeng atolan clommum.

At once there came a change for the noblemen, after Grendel’s mother penetrated inside.

She had seized in all its gore that well-known claw. Cares were renewed, known to that house. Nor was that a good exchange: they had to purchase it on both sides with the lives of friends.

Beowulf seized him at once with malicious purpose, setting himself against his arm.

Then it departed over the wavy sea, hurried by the wind, a float foamy-necked, very much like a bird, until about the same time on the second day, the whorled prow had traversed the distance, so that the sailors saw land, the shining sea-cliffs, the steep hills and the broad promontories. The sea-crossing was sailed, their voyage had ended.

The voice of harps was there and the ringing song of the scop. One spoke who knew best, of the creation of men, relating from long before. He told that the Almighty made the earth, a shining-bright plain, so surrounded by waters. He established both sun and moon, victorious and triumphant, the lamps of light for those living on land, and ornamented all the corners of the earth with limbs and leaves—he also shaped life itself in all kinds of creatures which quickly scurry about.","ða se ellengæst earfoðlice þrage geþolode, se þe in þystrum bad, þæt he dogora gehwam dream gehyrde hludne in healle; þær wæs hearpan sweg, swutol sang scopes.

That ferocious spirit was named Grendel, the notorious border-strider, who held the moors, the swampy stronghold, the lair of water-monsters, an unhappy creature, keeping them a long while, since the Shaper had condemned him as the kin of Cain—that killing had the Eternal Lord avenged, after the man had struck down Abel. Cain rejoiced not in that felony, but he banished him far away, the Measurer for those wicked deeds, from the kindred of men. From there was conceived all sorts of monstrous things, ogres and elves and revenants, likewise the giants who struggled against God for many ages— who gave them back their just deserts.","Swa ða drihtguman dreamum lifdon eadiglice, oððæt an ongan fyrene fremman feond on helle.

That wicked creature, grim and greedy, was instantly ready, savage and severe, and he snatched up thirty thanes from their rest. From there he soon departed, exulting in his spoils, venturing back to his home, seeking out his lair glutted by slaughter.","Gewat ða neosian, syþðan niht becom, hean huses, hu hit Hringdene æfter beorþege gebun hæfdon.

Afterwards they looked upon the trace of that loathed one, that accursed ghast. That struggle was too strong, hateful and long-lasting.

They are requesting that they, my prince, be allowed to exchange words with you.

There were many helmets there, old and rusted, many arm-bracelets, craftily twisted about.

I have guided my people for fifty winters—there was no folk-king, of any of those sitting on our borders, that dared to meet me with war-friends, menace us with terror.

Fire surged in waves, burning up his shield to the boss. The byrnie could not provide protection for the young spear-soldier, but the youth went in bravely under his kinsman’s shield, when his own was destroyed in the fire. Nevertheless the war-king recalled his heart, striking with powerful strength and his battle-sword, so that it crashed onto its head, compelled by violence. Nægling shattered. Beowulf’s sword abandoned him in the battle, ancient and grey-patterned. It was never granted him that the iron edge could help him in battle. His hand was too strong, I have heard, that overtaxed every sword with his swing, when he brought them to bear in warfare, the wound-hardened weapon— he was no whit the better for them.","æfter ðam wordum wyrm yrre cwom, atol inwitgæst, oðre siðe fyrwylmum fah fionda niosian, laðra manna; ligyðum for.

At once the old father of Ohthere, veteran and terrible, gave back a counter-attack, chopping down the sea-leader, rescuing his wife, the elderly queen, bereft of gold, the mother of Onela and Ohthere, and the Swedes dogged down their mortal foes, until they escaped with difficulty into the Ravenswood, deprived of their lord.","Ne ic to Sweoðeode sibbe oððe treowe wihte ne wene, ac wæs wide cuð þætte Ongenðio ealdre besnyðede Hæðcen Hreþling wið Hrefnawudu, þa for onmedlan ærest gesohton Geata leode Guðscilfingas.

Quickly room was cleared, as the ruler commanded, within the hall for those foot-bound visitors.","Gewat him ða se hearda mid his hondscole sylf æfter sande sæwong tredan, wide waroðas.

There she enjoyed, while she was living, the conditions of life afterwards at the throne of men, both good and well-known, holding the lord of heroes in high esteem, of all mankind—as I have heard— the best king of the human race found between the two seas. Therefore Offa was worthied widely with gifts and with wars, a spear-keen man, holding in wisdom where he ruled. Thence sprang Eomer, as a help to heroes, the kinsman of Hemming, the descendant of Garmund, crafty in troubled times [or “among men”].","ealodrincende oðer sædan, þæt hio leodbealewa læs gefremede, inwitniða, syððan ærest wearð gyfen goldhroden geongum cempan, æðelum diore, syððan hio Offan flet ofer fealone flod be fæder lare siðe gesohte; ðær hio syððan well in gumstole, gode, mære, lifgesceafta lifigende breac, hiold heahlufan wið hæleþa brego, ealles moncynnes mine gefræge þone selestan bi sæm tweonum, eormencynnes.

There were two premonitions within him, wise of age, but one was stronger: that they would never again be allowed to see each other, mindful in the moot.

The notorious golden cup came into his lap by the offender’s hand. That one was the thirteenth in that party, who started that conflict’s beginning, a captive mind-sad, he must go forth miserably, guiding them to the place. He went despite his desire unto the earthen house he alone knew, a barrow under the hillside, near the welling sea, the struggle of waves. That place was filled within with jewels and twisted gold. That horrid watchman, bold battle-ready, kept hold of golden treasures, old under the earth—that would be no easy bargain to obtain for any man.","Swa he niða gehwane genesen hæfde, sliðra geslyhta, sunu Ecgðiowes, ellenweorca, oð ðone anne dæg þe he wið þam wyrme gewegan sceolde.

It rushed back to its hoard, its secret hall just before daytime. The land-dwellers had been seized by fire, by flames and brands. It trusted more in its barrow its secret ways and walls.

The hoard-warden sought eagerly upon the earth, wishing to find the human who had sorely injured him as he slumbered. Hot and rough-minded, he stirred about the barrow, outside it all—but no one was there in the wastelands—no one yet to fête in warfare or fighting-work.

Then they boldly let fly forth showers of arrows, battle-serpents from horn-bows, sturdy missiles— they stormed loudly, angry warriors, sending their spears into the press of the cruel. The heroes were angry, dwellers of this land, at the hated race, stepping forth resolutely, determined, and they ungently roused their ancient foes, mead-weary—the retainers tugged with their hands bright-flecked swords from sheaths, their trusty edges, and struck earnestly the Assyrian warriors, those malicious schemers, sparing not one of those battle-men, neither low nor powerful, those living men whom they could overcome.","Stopon heaðorincas, beornas to beadowe, bordum beðeahte, hwealfum lindum, þa ðe hwile ær elðeodigra edwit þoledon, hæðenra hosp.

Assyrian glory was diminished by that day-work, their pride humbled. The warriors stood around the tent of their lord, quite troubled, with downcast spirits.
