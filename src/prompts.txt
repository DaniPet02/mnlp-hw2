1. Completely unacceptable translation: the translation has no
pertinence with the original meaning, the generated sentence is
either gibberish or something that makes no sense
2. Severe semantic errors, omissions or substantial add ons on the
original sentence. The errors are of semantic and syntactic nature.
It’s still something no human would ever write
3. Partially wrong translation, the translation is lackluster, it contains
errors, but are mostly minor errors, like typos, or small semantic
errors.
4. Good translation. The translation is mostly right, substantially
faithful to the original text, but the style does not perfectly match the
original sentence, still fluent and comprehensible, and could
semantically acceptable
5. Perfect translation. The translation is accurate, fluent, complete and
coherent. It retained the original meaning as much as it could.
